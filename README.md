## Introduction to NLP

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is a branch of AI that deals with the interaction between computers and human (natural) languages. NLP tasks aim to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is valuable. In this tutorial, we will explore the key steps involved in NLP, including text preprocessing, feature extraction, building models, and applying deep learning for text classification.

Throughout this repository, you will work on a series of mini-projects that will help you understand each NLP concept and develop practical skills.

## 1. Text Preprocessing

Before working with text data, it is essential to preprocess it. This step includes cleaning, tokenizing, and preparing the text for further analysis. In this section, you will learn:

- **Removing Noise**: Cleaning the text by removing special characters, stop words, and punctuation.
- **Tokenization**: Breaking the text into words or sentences.
- **Lowercasing**: Converting all characters to lowercase to maintain uniformity.
- **Lemmatization and Stemming**: Reducing words to their base forms.
  
### Example:
```python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

text = "Hello! This is an example sentence. Let's tokenize it."
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
print(tokens)
```

---

## 2. Part of Speech (POS) Tagging

Part of Speech (POS) tagging is a crucial task in NLP. It involves labeling words with their corresponding parts of speech (e.g., noun, verb, adjective).

In this section, you will learn:

- How to use **spaCy** or **NLTK** to perform POS tagging.
- How POS tagging helps in understanding the structure and meaning of a sentence.

### Example:
```python
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
doc = nlp(text)

for token in doc:
    print(token.text, token.pos_)
```

## 3. Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is the task of determining the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of a piece of text. In this section, you will:

- Learn how to perform sentiment analysis using deep learning.
- Use libraries like **Keras** or **Hugging Face**'s pretrained models to classify sentiment.

### Example:
```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load a pre-trained sentiment analysis model
sentiment_analyzer = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

result = sentiment_analyzer("I love this product!")
print(result)
```

---

## 4. Vectorizing Text

Text data needs to be converted into numerical form for machine learning algorithms to process it. This step is known as **vectorization**. 

In this section, you will learn about different techniques for text vectorization, including:

- **Bag of Words (BoW)**
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**
- **Word2Vec**
- **GloVe**
  
### Example:
```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

corpus = ["This is a sample sentence.", "This is another example sentence."]
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)

print(X.toarray())
```

---

## 5. Modeling

After preprocessing and vectorizing the text data, the next step is to build models for tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, or named entity recognition.

In this section, you will learn how to:

- Build simple models such as **Logistic Regression**, **SVM**, and **Random Forest**.
- Build deep learning models using **LSTM**, **GRU**, and **Transformer** architectures.

### Example:
```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, LSTM, Embedding

model = Sequential()
model.add(Embedding(input_dim=1000, output_dim=64))
model.add(LSTM(128))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

---

## 6. Building Your Own Text Classifier

In this section, you will build a **text classifier** from scratch. The goal is to classify text into predefined categories (e.g., spam vs. non-spam).

Steps involved:
- Preprocessing the text.
- Tokenizing and padding sequences.
- Building a model using **LSTM**, **CNN**, or **Transformer** architectures.
- Evaluating the performance of the classifier.

### Example:
```python
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

# Example of padding sequences
sequences = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7]]
padded_sequences = pad_sequences(sequences, padding='post')
print(padded_sequences)
```

## 7. Project: Text Classification with Deep Learning

In the final project, you will combine everything you've learned to build a **text classification model** using deep learning. The goal of this project is to classify text into different categories, such as spam detection, sentiment analysis, or topic categorization.

**Steps**:
1. Data Preprocessing: Tokenize and clean the text data.
2. Feature Extraction: Vectorize the text using **TF-IDF** or **Word2Vec**.
3. Model Building: Build a deep learning model using **LSTM**, **GRU**, or a Transformer-based model.
4. Evaluation: Evaluate the model on unseen data.
5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Tune the model's hyperparameters to improve performance.

### Example:
```python
from keras.layers import Dense, LSTM, Embedding

# Define and compile your model as in the previous section
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=64)
```

## Conclusion

By completing this tutorial, you will have a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts in NLP and how to implement deep learning techniques for solving real-world NLP problems. You'll also have hands-on experience building text classifiers, sentiment analysis models, and more.
